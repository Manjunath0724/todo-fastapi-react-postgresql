2.Make the website support multiple languages.
The default language should be English.
Add a language selection dropdown in the navbar.
When the user selects a language, all the website content (navbar, headings, paragraphs, buttons, forms, labels, messages, footer, etc.) should automatically change to the selected language instantly without reloading the page.
The selected language should remain saved even after refreshing the page.
