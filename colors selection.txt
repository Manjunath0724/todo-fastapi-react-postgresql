🌐 Gradients & Style
- Sidebar Gradient:
A dark-to-light blue gradient (navy → teal) is used in the left navigation panel, giving depth and modernity.
- Button Styles:
Rounded corners, flat design with hover effects (slight shadow or color shift). Primary buttons lean on cyan/teal backgrounds with white text.
- Problem Cards:
White background with subtle gray shadows, icons in teal/orange, and company tags in brand-specific accent colors.
- Daily Topic Section:
Alternating light backgrounds with teal highlights for active days, ensuring visual hierarchy.

- Spacing: Generous padding and margin, ensuring readability and a non-cluttered look.
- Icons: Flat, minimal, and color-coded (video, editor, company tags).

✨ Overall Design Language
- Modern & Minimalist: Heavy reliance on whitespace and flat UI elements.
